Clipboard Landing Page – Frontend Mentor
Project Overview

This project is a responsive Clipboard Landing Page built using Bootstrap 5 as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The goal was to recreate the provided design and ensure it works well on both mobile and desktop screens.

Approach & Customizations

Used Bootstrap’s grid system to create a mobile-first, responsive layout.

Implemented Bootstrap components such as buttons and cards.

Applied Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, alignment, and text styling.

Added minimal custom CSS only for handling different background images on mobile and desktop.

Challenges & Solutions

Responsive layout: Solved using Bootstrap breakpoints (col-md-*, flex-md-row).

Background images: Handled with simple media queries since Bootstrap utilities were not sufficient.
