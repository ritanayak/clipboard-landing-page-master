Reflection
----------

During this project, one of the main challenges was ensuring the layout was fully responsive across both mobile and desktop devices while closely matching the Frontend Mentor design. Adjusting spacing, alignment, and image positioning at different screen sizes required careful use of Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive utilities. Another challenge was handling background images for different breakpoints, as this could not be achieved using Bootstrap utilities alone.

To solve these issues, I followed a mobile-first approach and relied heavily on Bootstrap’s grid, utility classes, and components to keep the code clean and maintainable. Minimal custom CSS and media queries were added only when necessary.

If given more time, I would focus on further improving accessibility, refining spacing to better match the design, and optimizing performance by reducing unused styles and assets.
